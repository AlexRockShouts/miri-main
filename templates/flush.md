Internal Memory Flush:
- read existing memory.md / user.md / facts.json first
- extract new or updated facts, preferences, entities, open tasks
- always append, never overwrite 
- structure memory document as headings + bullet-points and JSON blocks
- output: "written: memory.md (+rows), facts.json"
